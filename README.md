# Fig

Fig is another ‚ÄúFigma to React‚Äù tool to generate and synchronize various template languages, designed to be AST-based, pluggable platform.

## Demo

Not perfect, but it seems pretty neat. [Give me a feedback](https://github.com/piglovesyou/fig/issues/new).

- [Website example](https://piglovesyou.github.io/fig/patagonia/public/Home_1%244.html), [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/pC6EOjjdZpS7PVsPTgjNLL/Patagonia?node-id=1%3A4)
- [Auto layout example](https://piglovesyou.github.io/fig/mini/public/Home_1$2.html), [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/MhB9ljAxaGlIk1IttXa09f/mini)
- [More pictures example](https://piglovesyou.github.io/fig/basic/public/Home_2$2.html), [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/QAIja81RKgYhQnIIJ0h9PJ/basic?node-id=0%3A1)

## Try it out (Note: Alpha spec)

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed in your machine.

Run this command in your terminal.

```bash
# Required options: --token token fileKey [fileKey ...]
$ npx @piglovesyou/fig-cli@latest --token YOUR_TOKEN FILE_KEY
```

- Get a **Figma access token** by following [this guide](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens).
- **fileKey** is in your browser location bar when you open a Figma file. It should look as https://www.figma.com/file/:fileKey/:title.

Then you'll find files generated like this.

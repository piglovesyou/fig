# Fig

Fig is another ‚ÄúFigma to React‚Äù platform designed as AST-based code generation, the pluggable architecture for multiple template languages, and synchronization to keep the generated code up-to-date.

## Demo

You can see a sample output. Not perfect, but it seems pretty neat. [Give me a feedback](https://github.com/piglovesyou/fig/issues/new).

- [A sample page generated by fig](https://piglovesyou.github.io/fig/patagonia/public/Home_1%244.html)
- [Its source Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/pC6EOjjdZpS7PVsPTgjNLL/Patagonia?node-id=1%3A4)

## Try it out (Note: Alpha spec)

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed in your machine.

```bash
# Required options: --token token fileKey [fileKey ...]
$ npx @piglovesyou/fig-cli@latest --token 0000-0000 pYYYY
```

* Get a **Figma access token** by following [this guide](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens).
* Open your Figma file by a browser and get **fileKey** from the location bar as https://www.figma.com/file/:fileKey/:title.

Then you'll find files generated like this.

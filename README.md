Figg is another ‚ÄúFigma to React‚Äù platform designed as AST-based code generation, the pluggable architecture for multiple template languages, and synchronization to keep code up-to-date.

## Demo

Compare the site and the source Figma file. Not perfect, but it appears pretty neat.

* [A site generated by figg](https://piglovesyou.github.io/figg/patagonia/)
* [The source Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/pC6EOjjdZpS7PVsPTgjNLL/Patagonia?node-id=1%3A4)

## Milestones

- [ ] Publish alpha release to generate simple React component source
- [ ] Make it pluggable to prepare multiple template language source
- [ ] Support another Stylesheet strategy perhaps to support Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Beta that supports another language, maybe Vue.js?

## Contributions

It's still in progress to design the plugin architecture. Please share this project and wait until it's prepared for contribution!

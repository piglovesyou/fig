# fig

Fig is another ‚ÄúFigma to React‚Äù platform designed as AST-based code generation, the pluggable architecture for multiple template languages, and synchronization to keep the generated code up-to-date.

## Demo

You can see a sample output. Not perfect, but it appears pretty neat. [Give me a feedback!](https://github.com/piglovesyou/fig/issues/new)

* [A sample page generated by fig](https://piglovesyou.github.io/fig/patagonia/public/Home_1%244.html)
* [Its source Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/pC6EOjjdZpS7PVsPTgjNLL/Patagonia?node-id=1%3A4)

## Getting started (Note: Alpha spec)

You can try out locally. Currently, the `fig` CLI is assumed to use in a front-end development envirionment. Please use it somewhere having `package.json`. Please note that the spec can be drastically changed in the future releases.

### 1. Install packages

(Alpha note) React modules are required since it's the only strategy currently fig supports.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @piglovesyou/fig-cli react react-dom
```

### 2. Make .figrc

Create a file named `.figrc` containing the following.

```yaml
baseDir: __generated__
componentsDir: components
pagesDir: pages
htmlDir: public
strategy: jsx
fileKeys:
  - pC6EOjjdZpS7PVsPTgjNLL  # This is my public sample Figma file!
```

### 3. Create token and store it in .env

Create Figma Personal Access Token. https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens

Then, create a file named `.env` as following. Replace `0000...` with your token.

```
TOKEN=000000-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

Don't include `.env` in your source. Add a line to `.gitignore`.

```
.env
```

### 4. Run fig!

```bash
npx fig
```

Look into the `__generated__` directory supposed to have React `*.tsx` files in it.

### 5. Generate HTML with

Additionally, you can generate HTML files if you have these packages.

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node
```

And your `tsconfig.json` has to have these options.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react",
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

Run `fig` CLI again,

```bash
npx fig
```

And you'll find some HTML files in the `__generated__/public` directory! Open it by the following (Mac):

```bash
open __generated__/public/Home_1\$4.html
```
